# Velodyne Dataset Utilities
This repository contains software for generating and reading binary datasets of Velodyne LiDAR frames.
## Generating Datasets
Given a `.pcap` packet capture file generated by running a Velodyne HDL-32E sensor, `parser.py` parses the file and outputs it into a directory of `.bin` binary frame files, containing only the azumith and distance data from the `.pcap` file for each frame.
## Reading from Datasets
To be developed.
