# Velodyne Dataset Utilities
This repository contains software for generating and reading binary datasets of Velodyne LiDAR frames.
## Generating Datasets
Given a `.pcap` packet capture file generated by running a Velodyne HDL-32E sensor, `parser.py` parses the file and outputs it into a directory of `.bin` binary frame files, containing only the azumith and distance data from the `.pcap` file for each frame.
## Reading from Datasets
`dove_dataset.py` contains the PyTorch dataset abstraction for the DOVe (Distance-Only Velodyne) dataset. By specifying a "clip length" and directory upon instantiation, the dataset is partitioned into clips of length _n_. The _i<sup>th</sup>_ clip containing _n_ frames can be read using `dataset[i]`, the data is read from the corresponding DOVe files at access time due to the size of the dataset. The DatasetLoader PyTorch class can be used to shuffle and accelerate reading of the data as normal.
